# Traffic Light Controller using Verilog

## 🚦 Project Overview
This project implements a **Traffic Light Controller** using Verilog HDL. The controller simulates the operation of a traffic signal system with proper timing and state transitions.

## 📋 Features
- Three-state traffic light system: Red, Yellow, Green
- State transitions based on clock cycles
- Verilog testbench for simulation and verification
- Clear, modular Verilog code structure

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Verilog HDL
- **Simulation:** ModelSim / Xilinx / Icarus Verilog
- **Version Control:** Git
